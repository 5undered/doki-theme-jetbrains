Hey! Before we go any further, I would like to ask you a couple of questions:

-  Do you need a bit more spice in your development life?
-  Are Light or Dark themes your thing?
-  Is your tolerance for cutesy things high?
-  Do you like stickers and chibis?
-  Is having a lot of choices a must?

Well look no further friend, **I've got what you are looking for!**


With over 15 themes (light and dark) I think you will be able to find your favorite.
You can even find one that fits your mood for the day.

Variety is the spice of life! So you can choose themes from the following Doki-Doki Theme Suites:

- Doki-Doki Literature Club
- Mistress's Menagerie


Too distracted by the chibi in the corner of your IDE?
No worries! You can configure them to be on or off at your leisure.

These themes are built on top of the awesome [Material UI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui)!
